# Analytic Flags

Observations, outliers, and data points flagged during quantitative analysis that warrant qualitative investigation or special handling in downstream phases. Each entry records **what** was observed, **where** (which analysis phase), **why** it matters, and **what to do about it**.

This is a living document — add entries as each analysis phase surfaces new findings.

## Flagged Legislators

### Sen. Caryn Tyson (R, District 12)

- **Phase:** PCA
- **Observation:** Extreme PC2 outlier (-24.8, more than double the next-most-extreme senator). PC1 is solidly Republican (+5.2).
- **Explanation:** Tyson has a 61.9% Yea rate — far below the Republican norm. She frequently casts lone or near-lone Nay votes on routine legislation that passes with near-unanimous support. PC2 captures this "contrarianism on routine bills" pattern.
- **Downstream:** Investigate whether this reflects a principled libertarian/limited-government stance (voting against bills she views as unnecessary) or something else. Check which specific bill categories she dissents on. In IRT, expect her ideal point to be well-estimated but offset from the main Republican cluster on a second dimension.

### Sen. Mike Thompson (R, District 10)

- **Phase:** PCA
- **Observation:** Third-most extreme PC2 (-8.0). Same direction as Tyson but milder.
- **Explanation:** Similar pattern — higher-than-typical Nay rate on routine bills (73.4% Yea rate). Shows a softer version of the Tyson contrarian tendency.
- **Downstream:** Same as Tyson. Check if Thompson and Tyson form a recognizable caucus or voting bloc. Clustering phase should reveal whether they consistently co-vote.

### Sen. Silas Miller (D, District ?)

- **Phase:** PCA
- **Observation:** Second-most extreme PC2 (-10.9). Only 30/194 votes (15.5%) — dead last in Senate participation.
- **Explanation:** Mid-session replacement. Previously served in the House with a normal voting record. Row-mean imputation filled 85% of his Senate matrix with his average Yea rate, producing an artificial PC2 extreme. **This is an imputation artifact, not a real voting pattern.**
- **Downstream:**
  - **IRT (Phase 4):** Use Miller as a **bridging legislator**. He served in both chambers, so a joint IRT model can use his ~300+ House votes to tightly constrain his ideal point, with the Senate votes further refining it. This is the standard "bridging observations" technique in the ideal-point literature.
  - **Clustering:** Exclude from Senate clustering or flag his cluster assignment as low-confidence.
  - **General:** Any analysis with a minimum-participation filter should note that Miller barely clears the 20-vote threshold. His estimates carry much more uncertainty than typical senators.

## Flagged Voting Patterns

### PC2 as "Contrarianism on Routine Legislation"

- **Phase:** PCA (Senate)
- **Observation:** PC2 (11.2% of variance) is driven by a cluster of near-unanimous bills where 1-2 senators dissent. The top PC2 loadings are routine bills (consent calendar, waterfowl hunting regs, bond validation, National Guard education).
- **Interpretation:** This is not a traditional ideological dimension. It captures a tendency to vote against the chamber consensus on uncontroversial legislation. Tyson is the primary driver, Thompson secondary, with Miller's position artifactual.
- **Downstream:** When interpreting Senate clustering results, the Tyson/Thompson pattern may create a spurious "cluster" that is really just two contrarian voters, not a substantive ideological faction. Consider whether PC2 should be downweighted or excluded in clustering inputs.
